        After being stuck in Peterborough all my life I decided I should go
        travel while I could, there's a few places I want to go. One of them has
        always been Mecca, with such great religious importance alongside such
        unique architecture it was a great change from plain old Peterborough.

        As a Muslim once in your life you need to perform an act called Hajj,
        and I thought this was the perfect chance to explore. Luckily during my
        visit I was able to get close enough to take a good picture of the
        Kaaba. The entire experience was fascinating to me as being in Canada my
        whole life I never could imagine a world so vastly different just a
        flight away. I shaved my head and tried new foods, but also saw a lot of
        interesting things like a hoarde of pigeons or a camel in the middle of
        the road but just the geography and culture as a whole was a new
        eye-opening experience. The streets were so clean in places it made
        Peterborough look like the slums... which is not something I ever
        expected I would say.
